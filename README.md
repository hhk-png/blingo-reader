**The project is developing**

Now you can visit the site [https://hhk-png.github.io/blingo-reader/]( https://hhk-png.github.io/blingo-reader/ ) to see some features of this reader, although it is incomplete and there are many features need to be added.

The next step is to complete the parser of unencrypted .mobi, azw, azw3, etc. file  and the reader ui. I'm exploring whether it could be possible to provide a unified API for different eBook file parser. This will save a lot of things. I will publish these parsing libraries to npm later.
