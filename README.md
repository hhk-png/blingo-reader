### Reasons for Using SVG in a Reader

1.SVG is a vector graphics format that can maintain high-quality text rendering at any resolution without distortion when zoomed in.

2.Cross-platform compatibility: SVG is supported by most browsers and devices. The SVG version of the eBook uses concatenated SVG strings at its core, ensuring that as long as the environment supports SVG rendering, the eBook's functionality will work properly.
